<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./public/project-overview.png)

My solution for devchallenge.io's Weather App challenge. I did it as a training project to get more confortable using React. This project was a bit more challenging than the previous one but was still pretty simple overall. I got better in css and got more comfortable fetching data with an API, using async/await functions and the organisation inside a React project.

I tried to make a fully responsive integration, although, the forecasts section could be improved a bit !

I could also improve a little the organisation of the component folder and make the "humidity highlight" a true "highlight component, like I did with the wind highlight.
Tests might also be added later. The rotation of the wind is neither pretty nor optimal.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

I completed all the user stories, even the optinal ones. I also added conversion of all unit from the metric to the imperial system while only the C° to F° was optionaly required.
